## Logic of social structure and social influence

what we do now

* The aspects that will explored by this group:

We emphasize the importance of social relations, and will study
    systematically how they play a role in social communication. We
   will explore social phenomena using tools from logic and computer
  science, specifically the mechanisms by which these phenomena can
   emerge from discrete interactions between individuals. As an
  example, the diffusion of an idea within a community can be
 modelled using cellular automata or dynamic modal logic. Of
  particular interest are epistemic interactions involving the
  exchange of information and social aspects of knowledge, such the
  ways in which knowledge can be said to be possessed by groups and
how this depends on social structure and capacity to communicate.
