## Belief revision guided by evidence and trust



Agents change their belief and opinions in social networks, under
the influence of other agents. Rational agents do so with a
reason, they may  collect evidence, or argument, to justify what
they do.  There are  various frameworks that have been developed
 to model it. For this project, we would like to compare the
  existing frameworks, and develop some tools that can help us to
  see how the opinions with evidence would spread and so that we
  could make predictions. In addition,  we would like to connect
  this to other theories, say, the learning theory, by asking how 
  we can ensure the group belief is approaching the true knowledge.
