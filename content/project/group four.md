## Strategical reasoning in social networks

* The aspects that will explored by this group:

Games are a powerful method for analyzing social practices, but
   also for designing new practices. They are also attractive because
    of their perspicuous links with logic and computation. In this
    part, we will study a variety of graph games that  model various
   basic social scenarios, and we do so in tandem with the
  development of new dynamic logics that specify  properties of the
   games and that encode reasoning about  players, equilibira and
    long-term temporal evolution. The result will be a systematic view
   of game design and logic design that spans the range from the
   study of actual games played in practice to the varieties of games
   found in the computational study of social networks, and even to
   the mathematical foundations of the logic-games interface.
