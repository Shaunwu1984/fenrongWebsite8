## Modeling formation and dynamics of social norms


* The aspects that will explored by this group:


This has a close relationship  with the theory of
   values/preference. In particular, we ask the following questions:
   how to aggregate / relate individual values, responsibilities,
  actions to collective/social values, responsibilities,  actions? 
  again, does social structures influence the process of
  aggregation? if so, how?  Next, regarding the formation of  social
  norms which has been studied by computer science through
 simulations, can we say anything about it from a logical point of
  view?  when we design robots or any AI systems, how do we embed
   social values / social norms / legal norms  to the systems so that
    their behavior can be aligned with human values and norms?
