# Logics of information Flow in Social Network

Living in a social world, we acquire knowledge，form our opinions through information. We interact and influence each other in social networks through various social relations. Understanding the logical structure of social networks is the key way to understand the laws of information flow. With a focus on social agency, this project studies the following two aspects: (a) epistemic state (b) agent’s behaviors. By using the latest logic systems, we systematically study many interesting social phenomena, rules that governing agents’ reasoning and inference, and dynamical change of an agent in epistemic or behavioral senses. Method from computer science, game theory, and other fields will be adopted whenever it is needed. 

The project is led by Fenrong Liu, supported by the Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China (NO. 17ZDA026).  There are over 20 investigators across China and abroad, with by Johan van Benthem, Xinwen Liu and Beishui Liao and Jeremy Seligman as subproject leaders.
