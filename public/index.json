We will explore social phenomena using tools from logic and computer science, specifically the mechanisms by which these phenomena can emerge from discrete interactions between individuals. As an example, the diffusion of an idea within a community can be modelled using cellular automata or dynamic modal logic. Of particular interest are epistemic interactions involving the exchange of information and social aspects of knowledge, such the ways in which knowledge can be said to be possessed by groups and how this depends on social structure and capacity to communicate.\n Jeremy Seligman (Auckland \u0026amp; Tsinghua)  MA Minghui (Sun Yan-sen University) DONG Huanfang (Tsinghua University) LIN Hanti (University of California, Davis) ZHU Rui (Auckland University) CHEN Yu (Tsinghua University)   ","date":1461254400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461254400,"objectID":"0ec00c7c4b1b22ef53ed63c8a391d89a","permalink":"/project/group-one/","publishdate":"2016-04-22T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/group-one/","section":"project","summary":"Logic of social structure and social influence.","tags":["Group One"],"title":"Group One","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Belief revision guided by evidence and trust Agents change their belief and opinions in social networks, under the influence of other agents. Rational agents do so with a reason, they may collect evidence, or argument, to justify what they do. There are various frameworks that have been developed to model it. For this project, we would like to compare the existing frameworks, and develop some tools that can help us to see how the opinions with evidence would spread and so that we could make predictions.

They are also attractive because of their perspicuous links with logic and computation. In this part, we will study a variety of graph games that model various basic social scenarios, and we do so in tandem with the development of new dynamic logics that specify properties of the games and that encode reasoning about players, equilibira and long-term temporal evolution. The result will be a systematic view of game design and logic design that spans the range from the study of actual games played in practice to the varieties of games found in the computational study of social networks, and even to the mathematical foundations of the logic-games interface.\n Johan van Benthem (Stanford \u0026amp; Tsinghua)  Dominik Klein (University of Bayreuth)\n GUO Meiyun (South West University) XIONG Zuojun (South West University) JIANG Guifei (Nankai University) Davide Grossi (University of Groningen) LI Dazhu (Tsinghua University)   ","date":1460995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1460995200,"objectID":"aec748dae59539ea4fe220483d773168","permalink":"/project/group-four/","publishdate":"2016-04-19T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/group-four/","section":"project","summary":"Strategical reasoning in social networks.","tags":["Group Four"],"title":"Group Four","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
