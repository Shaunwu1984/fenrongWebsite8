      <description>Modeling formation and dynamics of social norms  The aspects that will explored by this group:  This has a close relationship with the theory of values/preference. In particular, we ask the following questions: how to aggregate / relate individual values, responsibilities, actions to collective/social values, responsibilities, actions? again, does social structures influence the process of aggregation? if so, how? Next, regarding the formation of social norms which has been studied by computer science through simulations, can we say anything about it from a logical point of view?</description>
